 * "Something went wrong, send me the details" — as one button.
 *
 * The bundle is a single JSON file holding the logs, the build identity, the
 * settings (with anything password-shaped removed) and any recent crash
 * report. Collapsed by default: this is a support tool, not something anyone
 * needs during a show.
 *
 * The path is copied to the clipboard as well as shown, because nobody retypes
 * a path out of a dialog, and revealed in the file manager because on macOS it
 * lives under ~/Library/Logs, which is hidden in Finder by default.
